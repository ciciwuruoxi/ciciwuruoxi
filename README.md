About My Most Recent Work - Internship with Vasc-Alert
1. Database Integration – 10% of time
Contributed to building the company’s first datalake by consolidating 28 databases spanning six years into a unified AWS environment. Collaborated with two engineers to design schema mappings, create a composite patient key, and optimize tables for query performance. This reduced data retrieval time from hours to minutes and established a single reliable source of truth for analytics.

2. Dashboard Creation – 50% of time
Led the replacement of a 2005-era dashboard by first rebuilding the weekly ETL pipeline to standardize and refresh data automatically. Designed and implemented a new dashboard with standardized modules for score tracking, intervention history, and treatment outcomes, while improving usability with clear, interactive visuals. The result was faster reporting and real-time clinical insight.

3. Optimization – 40% of time

3.1 Automated Reader – Developed an automation pipeline replicating the “reader” function, using a rules-plus-ML hybrid model to parse structured/unstructured notes and match them against system records. This reduced manual review of “system-excluded data” from ~40 hours/week by over 80%.

3.2 NLP Model Training – Trained an NLP model to classify doctor notes into surgery types, achieving high accuracy on a labeled dataset I curated with a clinical dictionary. This cut review time by ~10 hours per 2,000 entries and improved billing accuracy by systematically correcting mis-coded interventions. It became the company’s first AI solution for non-numeric data.


In addition, I also developed other small models, supported cross-functional communication with engineers, executives, and clinical staff, and contributed to exploratory research. But the above was my three main achievement. 

About My Passion & Challenge of AI
I am passionate about data engineering because I believe that in the era of AI, the role of data engineers will become more critical—not less. While AI can automate many processes, the quality of training data directly determines the quality of models, making human expertise in building pipelines, curating datasets, and ensuring data integrity indispensable. To me, the key to success as a data professional is staying as close to the business as possible—understanding real-world problems, aligning data systems with business needs, and creating solutions that drive impact. This is the space where AI cannot fully replace human judgment, and it is where I aspire to make my contribution.
